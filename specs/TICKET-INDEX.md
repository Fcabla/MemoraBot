# üìã MemoraBot Implementation Tickets

## Overview
This index provides easy navigation to all implementation tickets for the MemoraBot project. Each ticket is designed to be self-contained with reduced context for focused implementation.

## How to Use These Tickets
1. Each ticket contains both **Detail** (requirements) and **Implementation** (technical specs) sections
2. Tickets can be implemented independently using custom commands with reduced context
3. Related files are listed in each ticket for quick reference
4. Dependencies are clearly marked to ensure proper implementation order
